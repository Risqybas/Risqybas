### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and curious developer deeply immersed in the world of **web development and system design**. As an Information Systems student, I'm always looking for opportunities to build, experiment, and grow through real-world coding challenges.

Right now, my current focus is on **front-end development**, **UI/UX design**, and understanding **backend logic**. I strongly believe that **consistency and curiosity** are the keys to becoming a better developer every day.
